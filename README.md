# rofretta-common
"Rofretta" is just another time waster project, something fun to hack away on now and then. The idea, if I follow through, is inspired by the ubuitious "todo app" implementation in the web app world. Take a simple premise, reimplement it several times, see what you learn. 

Only in this case, instead of doing a todo app, we're going to take on a slightly more complicated domain, guitar chords. We'll have to tackle a bit of music theory to make it challenging, but we'll try to put a limit on what we plan on implementing (otherwise we'll never have more than one implementation!).

This "common" repo holds files common across all implementations.
